## Overview

Romimghelper is a tool designed to assist in managing PNG files and placing them into corresponding ZIP folders alongside ROM files. Simply place this tool in the same directory as your ROMs and cover art, ensuring your cover art is named exactly like its corresponding ROM file (e.g., `ROM123.ZIP` and `ROM123.PNG`).

## Usage

### Moving PNG Files to ZIP Folders

Click the **Move PNGs** button to automatically move PNG files into their respective ZIP folders. Romimghelper detects matching names between PNG and ZIP files and performs the move operation.

### Deleting Remaining PNG Files

Click the **Delete PNGs** button to delete all remaining PNG files from the directory. A confirmation prompt ensures you proceed with this action.
